Initialization: The init function sets the required amount of ore.
Endpoints:
setOreRequirement: Allows the contract owner to set the ore requirement.
getOreRequirement: A view function to retrieve the current ore requirement.
mintShield: Handles the minting of the Shield NFT after burning the required ore.
Storage: Uses SingleValueMapper to store the ore requirement.
Token Handling: Placeholder functions (burn_tokens and create_nft) for burning tokens and creating NFTs.
Deployment and Testing
Compile the Contract:

cargo build --release --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown
Deploy the Contract:

Use MultiversX tools to deploy the compiled Wasm file to the Devnet.
Testing:

Use the MultiversX Devnet Explorer or SDK tools to interact with your contract and verify its functionality.
Additional Considerations
Security: Ensure to add proper checks and error handling to prevent misuse.
Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation to explain how to use and interact with the contract.
Open Source: Host the project on a platform like GitHub for collaboration and transparency.
